### Tech

#### React, Next.js
###### i love SSR, so i used it where it was good and possible. 
#### ShadeCN for the UI library.

### Purpose
This website was built for my friend, Or Barak, check it out here:
https://orbarak.net/

### More info
If you dig into the code, you will see that most of the website assets is built from local, constant links, which is bad, but in the future i hope to create a Dashboard panel, if it will be necesary.
